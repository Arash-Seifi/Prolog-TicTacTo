# TO RUN THE PROGRAM:
```
% swipl tic_tac_toe.pl
```
# HOW TO GIVE INPUT:
In Prolog's built-in command-line interface, after entering a number and pressing Enter, Prolog expects you to terminate the input with a period (.) and then press Enter again to confirm the input.

# Tic-Tac-toe
Tic-tac-toe, noughts and crosses, or Xs and Os is a paper-and-pencil game for two players who take turns marking the spaces in a three-by-three grid with X or O. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row is the winner.
